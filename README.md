An RPG shell game using java

The school project:

<blockquote>
  
Create a RPG game: 

For this project you can use elements you have developped during the 11 days of the pool. In order to make your player move you'll read the console inputs.

The game must have a multiplayer mode: so you can play with another player on the same server. In order to do that, the first player will have to create the server, and the second one will connect to that server.

Before starting the game, you can show a simple menu where the user can select the game mode: arcade or multiplayer.

The map must contain 3 reactions that can start a game (PlusMinus, Quiz and a third one that you will have to create), and as soon as you step on it, the mini game is launched. A mini game can be launched only if the player has the specific key:
Map contains only one key which is used to start the first mini game.
If you win the mini game, you get another key to play the second mini game. When the mini game is finished, you come back on the screen of the RPG (screen with map) and you continue to play.

Create another mini game of your choice.

Create some monsters/enemies on the map that can attack the player. Associate a keyboard key so the player can use weapons to attack the enemies.

Add some methods to drop the weapon on the map.

Create a functionality to select and use an item from the bag.

Player gets score points when he kills monsters.

Bind "show the scorebar" action to a key.

The complexity of the game will be rated.

Use design patterns in your project. You will have to explain the choice of design patterns used in the project.</blockquote>
